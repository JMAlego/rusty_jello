# Rusty Jello

## What is this?

Rusty Jello is a reimplementation of a program I created quite a few years ago called, you guessed it, Jello. Rusty Jello, like Jello before it, is a simple language created, effectively, as a pseudo-virtual-machine. It's more than a bit hack-y, but hey, it's helping me to learn Rust so...

## Why make it?

I needed more Rust practice, and it needed updating with a stack. _Stacks are fun!_

## Can I use this for something?

Sure! Not sure why you'd want to... just stick to the license.
